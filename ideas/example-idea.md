# Detailed Introduction

## What
A decentralized voting system that uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow DAO members to vote on proposals without revealing their identity or specific vote, while still ensuring that only eligible members participate and votes are counted correctly.

## Why
Current DAO voting systems face challenges with voter privacy, which can lead to various issues:
- Whales can influence others by revealing their votes early
- Members may face pressure or retaliation based on their voting decisions
- Public voting reduces participation for controversial topics

## How
1. Implement a zk-SNARK based voting system where:
   - Users generate a zero-knowledge proof to verify their eligibility to vote
   - Votes are encrypted but verifiably counted
   - Results can be verified without revealing individual votes
2. Integrate with existing DAO frameworks like Aragon, DAOhaus, or Colony
3. Create a user-friendly interface to reduce technical barriers to participation
